# FrontEnd Web Dev Project
Utah Parks Info Site
=======================================================

A simple informational website for National Parks in Utah. The site has a responsive design at multiple break points and has jQuery functionality. The jQuery library slick.js was used to create a carousel on camping.html. An API using AJAX was used to retrieve images from Flickr and create a gallery of recent photos.
